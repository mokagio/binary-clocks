# Binary Clocks

A [binary clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_clock) is a clock that displays the time of day in a binary format.

For example, here's the binary representation of 10:37:49:

```
H H M M S S

  0   0   1
  0 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1

1 0 3 7 4 9
```

I find the pattern they make mesmerizing, and coding one is a interesting exercise to try different languages and approaches.
